# Figma to Code – UI/UX Developer Machine Test

This project is a responsive React + Tailwind CSS conversion of a given Figma design, submitted as part of a UI/UX Developer machine test for Yellowfish Digital Innovations.



## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React** (Vite setup)

- **Figma** (Design source)
- **Responsive Design** for Web, Tablet, and Mobile



## 📱 Responsiveness

All sections are fully responsive across:
